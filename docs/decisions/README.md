# Decision Log Directory

Store project decisions here using slugged filenames (for example
`decisions/search-index-shard-strategy.md`). Copy the template from
`../templates-and-examples/templates/decisions/DEC-template.md` so every record
links to the supporting evidence, specs, tests, change-log entry, and status
updates.

## How to Use
1. Copy the decision template into this folder and rename it with a descriptive
   slug (no numeric `DEC-####` IDs required).
2. Fill in the context, options, decision, follow-ups, and traceability fields.
3. Update cross-links (change log, specs, requirements, tests, docs) after the
   decision is final.
4. Remove placeholder comments before committing.

Keep only the decisions that belong to your project; this starter kit
intentionally ships with no pre-populated entries.
