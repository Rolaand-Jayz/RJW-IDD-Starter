# Next-Steps Queue

Keep this file open during every RJW-IDD cycle. The agent updates it at the end
of each stage so the human always sees the live checklist.

- **Do Now (≤3)** — immediate tasks that unblock the current stage.
- **Do Next (≤5)** — queued follow-ups once the current stage is cleared.
- **Backlog** — longer term or blocked items to revisit later.
