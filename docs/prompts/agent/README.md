# Agent Prompts

Guardrails and reply formats the assistant should follow. Pair these with the
user prompts so both sides stay in sync.

For accelerated sessions, see `PROMPT-AGENT-yolo-mode.md` (auto approvals) and
`PROMPT-AGENT-turbo-mode.md` (reduced guard thresholds). Both mirror their
user-facing counterparts and define the machine-readable contracts for turbo
logging.
