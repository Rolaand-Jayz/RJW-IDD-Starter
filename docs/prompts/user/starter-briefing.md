# Starter Briefing Prompt

Use this before diving into a new repository or when you invite a new helper.

```
You are joining <project name>, which follows the RJW-IDD starter kit.

What you should know:
- Repository goal: <one sentence>
- Current milestone: <decision/spec/change log link>
- Known risks: <bullets>
- Source of truth locations:
  - Decisions: docs/decisions/
  - Specs: docs/specs/ (using templates in `templates-and-examples/templates/specs/`)
  - Runbooks: docs/runbooks/
  - Change log: copy from `templates-and-examples/templates/change-logs/`
  - Logs: logs/ (formats in `templates-and-examples/templates/log-templates/`)

Please:
1. Summarise the current state for a novice.
2. List the next RJW-IDD stage we should run and which template to copy.
3. Call out missing artifacts, evidence, or tests we must gather first.

Keep instructions concise and confirm before taking actions.
```
