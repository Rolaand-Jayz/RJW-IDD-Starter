# User Prompts

Starter prompts novices can paste into the assistant. They align with the
templates in `templates-and-examples/templates/prompts/user/` and cover the
full RJW-IDD cycle: core flow, stage helpers, glossary, examples, and merge
checks.

Need a faster loop? Use `core-yolo-flow.md` for auto-approvals or
`core-turbo-flow.md` when the team agrees to temporarily relax guard thresholds.
Both keep the RJW-IDD stages intact while surfacing every approval and TODO.
