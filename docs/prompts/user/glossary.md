# RJW-IDD Glossary Prompt

Use this when you need quick definitions for learners.

```
You are curating the RJW-IDD glossary.

New terms to add:
- <term 1>
- <term 2>

For each term provide:
- Plain-language definition (1–2 sentences).
- Where it appears in the workflow (decision/spec/runbook/test/log).
- Link to the template or example that demonstrates it.

Output as `- Term — definition (reference)` so I can paste it directly.
```
