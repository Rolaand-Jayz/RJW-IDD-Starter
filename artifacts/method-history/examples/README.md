# Legacy Examples

These JSON files capture the original agent-behaviour samples that seeded the
starter-kit re-org. They remain here for traceability only; the active good/bad
examples now live under `templates-and-examples/`.

- `root-directory-snapshot/` keeps the final copy that once shipped at
  `rjw-idd-starter-kit/examples/` before the consolidation.
