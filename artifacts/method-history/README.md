# Method History Artifacts

This folder preserves assets from the original RJW-IDD starter-kit build-out so
we can trace how the methodology evolved.  Files here are **not** part of the
public starter kit; they exist solely for historical reference.

- `examples/` keeps the initial agent-behaviour samples that used to live under
  `rjw-idd-starter-kit/examples/`.

Archive any other retired assets in this directory to maintain provenance.
