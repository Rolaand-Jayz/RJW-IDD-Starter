# Slot Car Racing — BONUS: 90-Minute Win (The Mastery Level)

## Welcome to the Advanced Round

You've built a professional 60-minute game. Now you're going beyond by **actually extending your game with real features**, following the RJW-IDD framework from start to finish.

**Time:** 30 minutes (90 minutes total from start, or standalone)  
**Format:** Real RJW-IDD cycle: Decide → Spec → Code → Verify → Commit  
**Audience:** You've mastered 60-minute; ready to own a real feature project.

## How This Works

This is **NOT a tutorial about building features.** This **IS building features** using the RJW-IDD framework.

**You own the decisions.** I'll research options, propose trade-offs, but you approve what we build.

**The Flow:**
1. I present **Feature Options** (impact, complexity, time estimates)
2. **You decide:** Which features matter to you?
3. I write **Specifications** for approved features
4. I get **AI to implement** your specifications
5. I **verify** the code works
6. I **commit** to git
7. I guide you through **what was built and why**

**Mode-aware:** This works in Turbo (default, fast), YOLO (build everything, review after), or any mode you prefer.

## Step 1: DECIDE — Feature Research & Proposal

I've researched what's possible to add to your 60-minute game. Here are the top candidates:

### Feature Proposals

| Feature | Impact | Complexity | Time | Why It Matters |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Track Editor** | High | High | 12 min | Players create custom tracks. Tests: modular subsystem design. |
| **Leaderboard** | High | Medium | 10 min | Competitive ranking. Tests: data persistence + UI integration. |
| **Colorblind Mode** | Medium | Low | 3 min | Accessibility. Tests: professional thinking beyond features. |
| **Performance Monitor** | Low | Low | 2 min | Dev tools (FPS counter). Tests: instrumentation practices. |
| **Local Multiplayer** | Very High | Very High | 20+ min | 2-player split-screen. **Too complex for 30 min.** Defer. |
| **Advanced Graphics** | Medium | High | 15+ min | Particles, shadows. **Polish over substance.** Defer. |

### My Recommendation

Build **Track Editor + Leaderboard + Colorblind Mode** (25 min total):
- Each teaches different lesson (modularity, persistence, professionalism)
- Achievable in 30-minute window
- Defers risky features (multiplayer, graphics)
- Scales in complexity

## Step 2: YOUR DECISION

**Which features do you want to build?**

Copy this template and respond:

```
I approve building:
- [ ] Track Editor (12 min)
- [ ] Leaderboard (10 min)
- [ ] Colorblind Mode (3 min)
- [ ] Performance Monitor (2 min)

I prefer: [ ] Turbo Mode (fast, I approve checkpoints) / [ ] YOLO Mode (build everything, I review after)

Deferring to later:
- Local Multiplayer
- Advanced Graphics
```

**Respond with your choices, and I'll write the specifications.**

## Next: Awaiting Your Decision

I'm ready to:
1. Write detailed specifications for your approved features
2. Implement the code with AI assistance
3. Verify everything works
4. Guide you through the entire process

**What features do you want?**
