# SPEC-3D-OBS-0001 â€” Telemetry & Observability Charter

- **Active Profile:** `<features.yml :: addons.3d_game_core.profile>`
- **Decisions:** `DEC-3D-OBS-0001` (event taxonomy), `DEC-3D-OBS-0002` (PII/consent)

## 1. Observability Goals
- Enumerate the questions telemetry must answer per sprint/release.
- Tie insights to profile-specific risks (e.g., camera comfort for `third_person`, latency for `networked`).

## 2. Metrics Catalogue
Document event streams, sample rates, retention, and downstream consumers.

| Metric ID (`OBS-####`) | Source | Schema Reference | Profile Sensitivity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OBS-3D-FRAME-0001` | Engine frame loop | `docs/metrics_schema.md` | All profiles |
| `OBS-3D-NET-0002` | Net transport | `docs/metrics_schema.md` | `networked` |
| `OBS-3D-CAMERA-0003` | Camera service | Custom schema | `first_person`, `third_person` |

## 3. Tooling Integration
- Hook to engine adapters for automated capture.
- Map metrics to dashboards/alerting; align thresholds with `performance_budgets` and `rollback` config.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- `TEST-3D-OBS-AC01`: Metrics dumps validate against schema and profile-specific required fields.
- `TEST-3D-OBS-AC02`: Alerts fire within 5 minutes of threshold breach in staging environments.
- `TEST-3D-OBS-AC03`: Observability pack reproduces determinism/tolerant replay instrumentation outputs.

## 5. Traceability
| Artefact | Identifier |
| --- | --- |
| Requirements | `REQ-3D-OBS-*` |
| Decisions | `DEC-3D-OBS-*` |
| Tests | `TEST-3D-OBS-*` |
| Integrations | `INTEG-3D-OBS-*` |

> **Profile Reminder:** Document any additional metrics fields introduced by individual profiles so the perf gate and tolerant replay tooling stay schema-aligned.
