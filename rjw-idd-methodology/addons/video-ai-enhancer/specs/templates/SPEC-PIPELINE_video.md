# SPEC-VIDEO-PIPELINE-0001 â€” Video Enhancement Pipeline Specification

## Overview
- **Objective:** Describe the real-time enhancement stack for `<project>`.
- **Add-in Profile:** `<baseline/live_stream/...>`
- **Latencies:** Glass-to-glass `<ms>`, pipeline `<ms>`, encode `<ms>`.

## Architecture
- Stage diagram with latency budget annotations.
- Model selection rationale, quantisation level, fallback strategy.
- Pre/post-processing filters and parameter sets.

## Observability & Guarding
- Telemetry endpoints feeding `quality_gate_video.py`, `latency_guard_video.py`, `storage_capture_validator.py`.
- Alert routing matrix and escalation owners.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Known content pathologies (e.g., rolling shutter, low light) and mitigation plans.
- Rollback procedure and testing hooks.
