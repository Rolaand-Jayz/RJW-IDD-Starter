# PROMPT-VIDEO-RESEARCH-0001 â€” Capture Enhancement Signals

**Goal:** Understand source content characteristics, latency limits, and enhancement goals.

1. Catalogue source formats, bitrates, and capture environments (lighting, motion, noise).
2. Identify business-critical moments that must upscale well (faces, text overlays, UI, motion).
3. Document quality objectives (VMAF, PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and latency tolerances by scenario.
4. Enumerate available compute targets (GPU/CPU/ASIC) and acceleration APIs.
5. Record downstream storage/export expectations (duration, retention, compliance).
