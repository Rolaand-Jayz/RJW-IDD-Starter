# PROMPT-VIDEO-QUALITY-0003 â€” Operate Quality & Latency Gates

1. Define thresholds for alerting when guard variance exceeds 5% of configured budgets.
2. Establish manual review cadence for samples flagged by quality gate (store in evidence locker).
3. Create runbooks for rapid rollback to fallback models when latency guard fails.
4. Capture telemetry metadata (profile id, build hash, model version, GPU utilisation).
5. Update stakeholders with quality trend dashboards derived from guard reports.
