# PROMPT-VIDEO-DESIGN-0002 — Architect the Enhancement Pipeline

1. Define pipeline topology (capture → prefilter → enhancer → post-filter → encode) and mark parallelisation points.
2. Select models per profile, including fallbacks and quantisation levels; document expected GPU/CPU utilisation.
3. Map latency budgets from config to each stage; highlight buffering and queue strategy.
4. Describe storage/capture integration, segment rotation, and resumable upload strategy.
5. Outline observability hooks (events, histograms, snapshots) required for the guard scripts.
