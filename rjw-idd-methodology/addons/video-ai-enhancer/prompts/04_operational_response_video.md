# PROMPT-VIDEO-OPS-0004 â€” Operational Response Playbook

1. Define health checks for enhancement models (load time, warmup duration, GPU memory).
2. Capture fallback matrix (quality drop, latency change) when switching to lighter models.
3. Establish alert routing for guard failures (quality, latency, storage) with escalation owner.
4. Document manual overrides for retention/segment trims to stay within storage budgets.
5. Track learnings in RCA logs with RJW-IDD identifiers for future training data updates.
