# SPEC-0301 â€” Performance & Experience Metrics Template

**Linked Requirements:** Add performance/experience requirement IDs.  
**Status:** Template

## Purpose
Establish how teams collect and interpret performance, reliability, and user experience metrics for AI-assisted workflows while respecting consent constraints.

## Scope
- Applies to all automation, prompts, and tooling governed by RJW-IDD.
- Covers latency, success rate, satisfaction, and qualitative feedback signals.

## Expectations
1. Define baseline metrics (latency, success/failure counts, satisfaction proxy) and their target thresholds.
2. Instrumentation must emit metrics only after consent is granted and store artefacts locally or within approved systems.
3. All metrics include the traceability triple (`req_id`, `spec_id`, `test_id`) so incidents can be routed quickly.
4. Dashboards or reports should live under `logs/` or project-specific observability locations with Change Log references.
5. Sampling windows and alert thresholds are reviewed at least quarterly or when evidence changes.

## Implementation Guidance
- Start with lightweight collectors (JSON logs or CSV snapshots) before integrating external telemetry stacks.
- Document metric definitions, data retention, and access controls in living documentation.
- Use cost dashboards (`SPEC-0602`) and security runbooks (`docs/runbooks/security-incident-runbook.md`) to coordinate when metrics reveal anomalies.

## Audit Notes
- Governance Sentinel verifies consent receipts and metric snapshots during audits.
- Any change to metric definitions or tooling requires a decision log entry and spec update.
