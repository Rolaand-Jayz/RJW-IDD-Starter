# SPEC-0701 — Deployment & Operations Template

**Linked Requirements:** REQ-0701-0750 range  
**Linked Decisions:** DEC-DEPLOY-####  
**Status:** Active

## Purpose
Define deployment pipelines, release processes, rollback procedures, and environment promotion strategies to ensure safe, auditable transitions from implementation to production.

## Scope
- Covers deployment automation, environment management, release gates, and rollback procedures.
- Applies to all services and components governed by RJW-IDD.
- Integrates with existing quality gates (`SPEC-0201`) and observability requirements (`SPEC-0401`).

## Environment Strategy

### 1. Environment Tiers
- **Development:** Local workspaces and shared dev environments for active implementation.
- **Staging:** Production-equivalent environment for final validation and rehearsal.
- **Production:** Live customer-facing systems with full observability and backup.

### 2. Promotion Gates
Each environment transition requires:
- Passing all quality gates from `SPEC-0201`.
- Successful smoke tests in target environment.
- Updated Change Log entry with deployment timestamp and verification.
- Governance Sentinel sign-off for production deployments.

## Deployment Pipeline

### 1. Automated Build & Package
- CI pipeline creates immutable artifacts (containers, packages, binaries).
- Artifacts tagged with commit SHA, build timestamp, and semantic version.
- Build outputs stored with retention policy (minimum 90 days for production releases).

### 2. Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- Maintain parallel production environments (blue=current, green=new).
- Route traffic to green after validation; keep blue as instant rollback target.
- Document cutover decision in Change Log with approval chain.

#### Canary Release
- Deploy to subset of production infrastructure (e.g., 5% → 25% → 100%).
- Monitor error rates, latency, and business metrics at each stage.
- Automated rollback if canary metrics exceed variance thresholds.

#### Rolling Update
- Gradual replacement of instances with zero-downtime requirement.
- Health checks validate each instance before proceeding.
- Pause and rollback capabilities at every increment.

### 3. Feature Flags
- Runtime toggles for new features independent of deployment.
- Feature flag state tracked in `method/config/features.yml` or environment-specific config.
- Flag changes require Change Log entry and decision record for production.

## Rollback & Recovery

### 1. Rollback Triggers
- Automated: Error rate spike, latency breach, failed health checks.
- Manual: Governance Sentinel or on-call engineer judgment.
- Business: Customer-facing impact detected by support or monitoring.

### 2. Rollback Procedures
1. Activate previous deployment version (blue-green switch or version revert).
2. Verify service restoration via smoke tests and dashboards.
3. Create incident record under `artifacts/integration/incident-<timestamp>/`.
4. Draft `DEC-####` documenting root cause and prevention steps.
5. Update Change Log with rollback event, verification, and follow-up plan.

### 3. Data Migration Rollback
- Schema changes must be backward-compatible or provide migration scripts.
- Database backups taken before any migration with restore procedure tested.
- Document rollback impact on data consistency in deployment plan.

## Production Readiness Checklist

Before production deployment, verify:
- [ ] All quality gates passed (`scripts/ci/test_gate.sh` clean).
- [ ] Staging environment validation complete with smoke tests logged.
- [ ] Observability instrumentation active (metrics, logs, traces).
- [ ] Runbooks updated with new operational procedures.
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures tested within 7 days.
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and rehearsed.
- [ ] On-call rotation notified with deployment window.
- [ ] Change Log entry prepared with deployment plan and approval chain.
- [ ] Security scan results reviewed and mitigations addressed.
- [ ] Load testing completed if traffic patterns change.

## Deployment Verification

### 1. Smoke Tests
- Critical path validation (authentication, core API endpoints, data flows).
- Execute within 5 minutes of deployment completion.
- Failures trigger automatic rollback in automated pipelines.

### 2. Monitoring Windows
- 15-minute observation period for canary deployments.
- 1-hour observation for full production rollouts.
- 24-hour enhanced monitoring with on-call availability.

### 3. Success Criteria
- Error rates within baseline ±5%.
- P95 latency within SLO targets (defined in `SPEC-0801`).
- No critical alerts fired.
- Business metrics (transactions, sign-ups, etc.) consistent with forecast.

## Change Control

### 1. Deployment Approvals
- **Development/Staging:** Implementation Wrangler approval.
- **Production (standard):** Governance Sentinel + Service Owner.
- **Production (emergency):** Any two governance board members + post-incident review.

### 2. Deployment Windows
- Standard releases: Defined maintenance windows with customer notification.
- Emergency hotfixes: 24/7 with escalation protocol.
- Freeze periods: No deployments during high-traffic events or holidays (document exceptions).

### 3. Audit Trail
- Every deployment logs to `logs/deployments/deploy_<timestamp>.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:23:00Z",
    "environment": "production",
    "version": "v1.2.3",
    "commit": "abc123",
    "operator": "ROLE-NAME",
    "strategy": "blue-green",
    "approvals": ["SENTINEL", "SERVICE-OWNER"],
    "verification": "logs/ci/smoke_tests_20251003T142300Z.log"
  }
  ```

## Infrastructure as Code

### 1. Configuration Management
- All infrastructure defined in version control (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes manifests).
- Changes follow same governance as application code (tests, reviews, Change Log).
- Drift detection runs daily with alerts for manual modifications.

### 2. Secrets Management
- No secrets in version control or application artifacts.
- Rotation schedule documented in `docs/runbooks/DOC-0019-secrets-rotation.md`.
- Secrets tied to environment, not deployment version.

## Traceability

- Link deployment entries to `change_id` in Change Log.
- Cross-reference deployment decisions (`DEC-DEPLOY-####`) with relevant specs and requirements.
- Integration transcripts for complex deployments stored under `artifacts/integration/deployment-archive/`.

## Implementation Guidance

- Start with manual deployment checklists; automate incrementally.
- Use staging as production rehearsal—deploy there first, always.
- Document deployment-specific configurations in `docs/implementation/deployment-config.md`.
- Extend this spec with cloud-provider-specific details (AWS, Azure, GCP) as needed.

## Verification

- Deployment logs and smoke test results attached to Change Log verification column.
- Governance Sentinel audits deployment artifacts and rollback readiness quarterly.
- Successful rollback drill required before first production deployment and annually thereafter.

## Follow-Up Guidance

- Coordinate with `SPEC-0801` (SLO/SLI) to define success criteria thresholds.
- Reference `docs/runbooks/deployment-runbook.md` for step-by-step deployment procedures.
- Capture deployment-specific decisions in `docs/decisions/` when patterns change.
