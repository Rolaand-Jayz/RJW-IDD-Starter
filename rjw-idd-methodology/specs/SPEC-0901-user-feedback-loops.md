# SPEC-0901 — User Experience & Feedback Framework

**Linked Requirements:** REQ-0901-0950 range  
**Linked Decisions:** DEC-UX-####  
**Status:** Active

## Purpose

Establish practices for collecting, analyzing, and acting on user feedback to drive continuous improvement of AI-assisted development workflows and delivered products.

## Scope

- Covers user research, feedback collection, usability testing, accessibility, and internationalization.
- Applies to both internal tooling (RJW-IDD workflows) and external products built using the methodology.
- Integrates with decision records (`DEC-####`) and implementation tracking (`SPEC-0101`).

## User Research & Discovery

### 1. User Personas

Define and maintain user personas in `docs/implementation/user-personas.md`:

- **Target users:** Roles, experience levels, goals, pain points.
- **Usage patterns:** Frequency, context, device/environment constraints.
- **Success criteria:** What makes the experience valuable for this persona.

### 2. Research Methods

- **Interviews:** 1-on-1 sessions to understand needs, workflows, and frustrations.
- **Surveys:** Quantitative data on satisfaction, feature usage, and priorities.
- **Observation:** Watch users interact with system; identify friction points.
- **Analytics:** Track usage patterns, error rates, abandonment funnels.

### 3. Research Cadence

- **Quarterly:** Conduct user research sprint; update personas and priorities.
- **Monthly:** Review analytics and support tickets for emerging patterns.
- **Ad-hoc:** Research before major feature work or architectural changes.

## Feedback Collection

### 1. Feedback Channels

#### In-App Feedback
- Contextual feedback buttons in UI: "Report Issue" / "Suggest Improvement".
- Capture: user action, screen/context, timestamp, user ID (if authenticated).
- Store: `logs/feedback/user-feedback-<timestamp>.json`.

#### Support Tickets
- Track common issues and feature requests in ticketing system.
- Tag tickets with relevant `REQ-####` or `DEC-####` identifiers.
- Monthly summary shared with Spec Architect and Governance Sentinel.

#### User Surveys
- Post-deployment satisfaction surveys (e.g., NPS, CSAT).
- Feature-specific feedback after 7/30/90 days of availability.
- Target response rate: 10% of active users.

#### Community Forums
- Monitor discussion forums, Reddit, GitHub issues, Discord/Slack.
- Harvest insights using RDD evidence framework (`SPEC-0003`).
- Tag forum feedback with `EVD-####` identifiers.

### 2. Feedback Triage

**Weekly Review:**
- Categorize feedback: bug report, feature request, usability issue, documentation gap.
- Assign severity: critical (blocks core workflow), high (major friction), medium (enhancement), low (nice-to-have).
- Create requirements or decisions for high-impact feedback.

**Monthly Aggregation:**
- Identify top themes and recurring pain points.
- Present summary to Governance Board for prioritization.
- Update product roadmap and `docs/living-docs-reconciliation.md`.

## Usability Testing

### 1. Testing Methods

#### Moderated Testing
- Recruit 5-8 users per testing session.
- Provide realistic scenarios; observe and record interactions.
- Document friction points, confusion, and workarounds.

#### Unmoderated Testing
- Use tools like UserTesting, Maze, or Hotjar for remote testing.
- Define success criteria: task completion rate, time-on-task, error rate.
- Analyze recordings for usability issues.

#### A/B Testing
- Test design/flow variations with statistical rigor.
- Minimum sample size: 1000 users per variant (or as statistically significant).
- Document experiment design in `DEC-UX-AB-####`.

### 2. Testing Cadence

- **Before launch:** Test critical flows with 5+ users.
- **Post-launch:** Conduct usability review 30 days after major release.
- **Ongoing:** Monthly session for new features or reported issues.

### 3. Usability Metrics

- **Task Success Rate:** % of users completing intended task.
- **Time-on-Task:** Duration to complete core workflows.
- **Error Rate:** Mistakes, retries, help requests during task.
- **Satisfaction:** Post-task ratings (e.g., Single Ease Question: "How easy was this?").

Store metrics in `logs/usability/usability-metrics-<timestamp>.json`.

## Accessibility (a11y)

### 1. Accessibility Standards

Follow **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** guidelines:
- Perceivable: Text alternatives, adaptable layouts, distinguishable content.
- Operable: Keyboard accessible, sufficient time, seizure-safe, navigable.
- Understandable: Readable, predictable, input assistance.
- Robust: Compatible with assistive technologies.

### 2. Implementation Requirements

- **Semantic HTML:** Use proper heading hierarchy, landmarks, ARIA labels.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements accessible via keyboard.
- **Color Contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text.
- **Screen Reader Support:** Test with NVDA (Windows), JAWS, VoiceOver (macOS/iOS).
- **Focus Indicators:** Visible focus states on all interactive elements.

### 3. Accessibility Testing

- **Automated:** Run axe DevTools, WAVE, or Lighthouse audits in CI.
- **Manual:** Test with keyboard-only navigation and screen reader.
- **User Testing:** Include users with disabilities in usability sessions.

### 4. Accessibility Checklist

Before production deployment:
- [ ] Automated accessibility scan passed (0 critical issues).
- [ ] Keyboard navigation verified for all interactive elements.
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed (VoiceOver or NVDA).
- [ ] Color contrast validated for all text and UI elements.
- [ ] Forms have proper labels and error messages.
- [ ] Video/audio content has captions/transcripts.

Document accessibility testing in `logs/accessibility/a11y-report-<timestamp>.md`.

## Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (l10n)

### 1. Internationalization Strategy

#### Text Externalization
- All user-facing strings in external resource files (JSON, YAML, gettext).
- No hard-coded text in source code.
- String keys follow convention: `<module>.<context>.<key>`.

#### Locale Support
- Define supported locales in `docs/implementation/supported-locales.md`.
- Priority order: en-US (baseline), then by user base or market priority.
- Document locale-specific considerations (date formats, currencies, cultural norms).

#### Pluralization & Gender
- Use proper plural forms (e.g., ICU MessageFormat, i18next).
- Avoid gender-specific language where possible; support neutral options.

### 2. Localization Workflow

1. **Extract:** Generate string catalog from codebase.
2. **Translate:** Send to translation service or community.
3. **Review:** Native speaker QA for accuracy and cultural appropriateness.
4. **Deploy:** Update locale files and test in target environment.
5. **Verify:** Spot-check UI for text truncation, layout issues.

### 3. Localization Testing

- **Pseudo-Localization:** Test with expanded text (30% longer) to catch layout issues.
- **RTL Languages:** Verify right-to-left layouts (Arabic, Hebrew) if supported.
- **Character Sets:** Test Unicode support (emoji, CJK characters, accents).

Document localization coverage in `docs/implementation/localization-coverage.md`.

## Satisfaction Metrics

### 1. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**Question:** "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend this to a colleague?"

- **Promoters (9-10):** Enthusiastic supporters.
- **Passives (7-8):** Satisfied but unenthusiastic.
- **Detractors (0-6):** Unhappy users.

**Calculation:** `NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors`

**Target:** NPS > 30 (internal tools), NPS > 50 (customer-facing products).

### 2. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

**Question:** "How satisfied are you with [feature/experience]?"

- Scale: 1 (Very Dissatisfied) to 5 (Very Satisfied).
- **Target:** CSAT > 4.0 average.

### 3. Customer Effort Score (CES)

**Question:** "How easy was it to [complete task]?"

- Scale: 1 (Very Difficult) to 7 (Very Easy).
- **Target:** CES > 5.5 average.

Store satisfaction metrics in `logs/satisfaction/satisfaction-<timestamp>.json`.

## Feedback-Driven Development

### 1. Prioritization Framework

Map feedback to impact vs. effort:
- **Quick Wins:** High impact, low effort → Implement immediately.
- **Big Bets:** High impact, high effort → Plan for next quarter.
- **Fill-Ins:** Low impact, low effort → Backlog for downtime work.
- **Money Pit:** Low impact, high effort → Deprioritize or reject with rationale.

Document prioritization decisions in `DEC-UX-PRIORITY-####`.

### 2. Feedback Loop Closure

- **Acknowledge:** Respond to feedback within 48 hours (automated or manual).
- **Update:** Notify users when their feedback is implemented.
- **Measure:** Track if change improved satisfaction/usability metrics.

### 3. Public Roadmap

- Maintain public roadmap showing planned features and status.
- Link roadmap items to user requests and decision records.
- Update monthly; communicate changes via blog or changelog.

## Integration with RJW-IDD

### 1. Evidence Harvesting

- User feedback qualifies as evidence for RDD (`SPEC-0003`).
- Tag feedback with `EVD-UX-####` identifiers.
- Curate high-signal feedback into `research/evidence_index.json`.

### 2. Requirement Generation

- User feedback drives new requirements (`REQ-UX-####`).
- Document in `artifacts/ledgers/requirement-ledger.csv`.
- Link to specs, tests, and implementation tracking.

### 3. Decision Documentation

- Major UX changes require decision records (`DEC-UX-####`).
- Document options, trade-offs, and user research supporting decision.
- Cross-link to feedback sources and satisfaction metrics.

### 4. Change Log Integration

- User-facing changes logged in `templates-and-examples/templates/change-logs/CHANGELOG-template.md`.
- Reference user feedback that inspired change.
- Include before/after satisfaction metrics if available.

## Traceability

- Link user personas to requirements (`REQ-PERSONA-####`).
- Cross-reference feedback items with specs and tests.
- Tag usability issues with severity and resolution timeline.
- Track accessibility issues separately with remediation priority.

## Implementation Guidance

- Start with one feedback channel (e.g., support tickets or in-app feedback).
- Conduct initial user research to establish baseline personas.
- Implement accessibility checklist before first production deployment.
- Plan i18n support early; retrofitting is expensive.
- Document UX decisions in `docs/decisions/` to maintain rationale.

## Verification

- Satisfaction metrics included in monthly Change Log summaries.
- Accessibility audits conducted quarterly and after major UI changes.
- Usability test results attached to Change Log for significant features.
- Governance Sentinel reviews feedback triage process during audits.

## Follow-Up Guidance

- Coordinate with `SPEC-0801` (SLO/SLI) for user-facing performance metrics.
- Reference `DOC-0025-ux-research-playbook.md` for detailed research procedures.
- Integrate with `SPEC-0701` to include UX validation in deployment gates.
- Capture UX-specific decisions in `docs/decisions/` when design patterns evolve.
