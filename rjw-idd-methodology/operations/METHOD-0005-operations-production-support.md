## 5. Integration with Development Cycles

### Reliability Sprint

**Trigger:** Error budget exhausted; freeze feature work until reliability restored.

**Process:**
1. Analyze top contributors to SLO violations (by incident, endpoint, error type).
2. Prioritize fixes: highest impact on SLO compliance first.
3. Implement fixes following standard RJW-IDD process (RDD → SDD → Implementation).
4. Deploy fixes with enhanced monitoring; verify SLO improvement.
5. Resume feature work once error budget replenished or Governance Board approves exception.

**Documentation:** Reliability sprint scope and outcomes in `DEC-RELIABILITY-####`.

### Feature Work vs. Operational Work Balance

**Guideline:** Allocate engineering capacity
- **70% Feature development:** New capabilities, enhancements.
- **20% Technical debt:** Refactoring, test coverage, dependency updates.
- **10% Operational improvements:** Runbooks, alerts, tooling, automation.

**Adjustment:** Increase operational allocation if:
- Incident rate exceeds target (>1 SEV-1 per month).
- MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) trending upward.
- On-call engineer feedback indicates runbook/tooling gaps.

## 6. Operational Metrics

Track in `logs/operational-metrics/`:

## 7. Operational Improvement Cycle

### 1. Identify Gaps

**Sources:**
- Incident postmortems highlighting systemic issues.
- SLO violations revealing instrumentation or capacity gaps.
- User feedback indicating usability or performance problems.
- On-call engineer feedback about runbook or tooling deficiencies.

### 2. Prioritize Improvements

Use impact vs. effort framework:
- **High Impact, Low Effort:** Implement immediately (add alert, update runbook).
- **High Impact, High Effort:** Plan for next quarter (automation project, architecture change).
- **Low Impact, Low Effort:** Backlog for downtime work.
- **Low Impact, High Effort:** Deprioritize or reject with rationale.

### 3. Execute Improvements

Follow standard RJW-IDD process:
- **RDD:** Gather evidence (incident data, user feedback, industry best practices).
- **SDD:** Define requirements, update specs (e.g., `SPEC-0801` for new SLI).
- **Implementation:** Implement, test, document, deploy.
- **Verification:** Measure impact (e.g., MTTR decreased, satisfaction improved).

### 4. Measure & Iterate

- Track operational metrics before and after improvement.
- Document outcomes in `DEC-OPS-####`.
- Share learnings across teams; update methodology if broadly applicable.

## 8. Escalation & Crisis Management

### Crisis Declaration

**Criteria for declaring crisis:**
- Complete service outage lasting >15 minutes.
- Data loss or security breach affecting customers.
- Cascading failures across multiple systems.
- Public reputation impact (negative press, social media outcry).

**Crisis Response Team:**
- **Incident Commander:** Senior engineer (on-call or escalated).
- **Technical Lead:** Domain expert for affected system.
- **Communications Lead:** Interface with customers, support, executives.
- **Executive Sponsor:** VP Engineering or CTO for high-level decisions.

**Crisis Communication:**
- Internal: 15-minute updates in crisis channel.
- External: Hourly status page updates; customer communication via support.
- Post-crisis: Public postmortem (anonymized, blameless) within 7 days.

### Escalation Chain

**Technical Escalation:**
1. On-call primary → On-call secondary (if no response in 5 minutes)
2. On-call secondary → Service owner (if expertise needed)
3. Service owner → Engineering manager (if resources needed)
4. Engineering manager → VP Engineering (if executive decision required)

**Business Escalation:**
- **SEV-1:** Notify executive team and customer success within 15 minutes.
- **SEV-2:** Notify product management and customer success within 30 minutes.
- **Crisis:** Activate crisis response team immediately.

## 9. Operational Documentation
