# DEC-0001 — Anchor Method Governance Artefacts

**Decision Date:** 2024-03-27
**Participants:** Evidence Lead; Spec Architect; Implementation Wrangler; Security & Privacy Liaison

## Problem Statement
RJW-IDD needs a persistent governance spine so future changes to the methodology can trace decisions, audits, and validation evidence without ambiguity.

## Candidate Thoughts
1. Keep governance artefacts implicit and rely on downstream projects to record decisions.
2. Ship lightweight placeholders (README stubs) and let projects materialise the artefacts when needed.
3. Create fully qualified method-level artefacts (decision log, change log, stage-audit log) alongside updated guidance that references them explicitly.

## Evaluation
- **Option 1:** Lowest immediate effort but breaks auditability; contradicts METHOD-0001 principles.
- **Option 2:** Keeps bundle trim yet still leaves a gap—roles lack concrete paths and early adopters repeat bootstrap work.
- **Option 3:** Requires curating docs now, but ensures the methodology exports with governance ready-to-use and aligns all guidance with a single source of truth.

## Outcome
**Selected:** Option 3 — Provide ready-to-use governance artefacts and align doctrine language so the methodology can be adopted without extra scaffolding work.

**Rejection Rationale:**
- Option 1 rejected because it erodes traceability and prevents consistent audits.
- Option 2 rejected because placeholders still offload effort to adopters and risk drift between documents and reality.

## Cross-Links
- `METHOD-0001`
- `METHOD-0002`
- `METHOD-0003`
- `LOG-0001`

## Follow-Up Actions
1. Populate `docs/change-log.md` entry `change-20240327-01` once validators run against the refreshed methodology pack.
2. Run the next quarterly governance review to confirm add-in packs stay aligned with the new artefact references.

## Status Update — 2024-03-27
Governance artefacts created (`docs/decisions/`, `docs/change-log.md`, `logs/LOG-0001-stage-audits.md`) and doctrine updated to reference them. Add-in parity review scheduled.
