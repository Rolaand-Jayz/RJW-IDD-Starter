# Runbook Templates

The runbook templates capture the structure every operational playbook should
follow: purpose, triggers, step-by-step response, automation hooks, and audit
expectations.  Copy one when you introduce a new operational workflow and update
the examples under `../../good/` and `../../bad/` to keep the training material
fresh.
