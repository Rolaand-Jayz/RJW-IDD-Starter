## Penetration Test Results

**Test Date:** 2024-12-15  
**Vendor:** [External Security Firm]  
**Scope:** API endpoints, authentication flows

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| SQL Injection | PASS | No vulnerabilities found |
| XSS | PASS | Output properly encoded |
| CSRF | PASS | Tokens validated |
| Auth Bypass | PASS | No bypass routes found |
| Rate Limiting | PASS | Limits enforced |

**Summary:** No critical vulnerabilities. Recommendations implemented.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement automated secret rotation (DEC-SEC-###)
2. Update transcript archival to sanitize errors
3. Document key rotation in runbook (docs/runbooks/deployment-runbook.md)

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement security information and event management (SIEM)
2. Add automated compliance scanning to CI
3. Conduct security awareness training for team

## Security Drill Template

```markdown
# Security Drill - <Type> - <Date>

**Drill ID:** DRL-YYYY-###  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Type:** [Sandbox Reset | DR Test | Incident Response | Penetration Test]  
**Participants:** [List team members]  
**Duration:** X hours

## Objectives

1. [Primary objective]
2. [Secondary objective]
3. [Learning objective]

## Scenario

[Describe the drill scenario - e.g., "Simulate data corruption requiring restore from backup"]

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [x] Review runbook (docs/runbooks/security-incident-runbook.md)
- [x] Assemble drill team
- [x] Set up monitoring
- [x] Notify stakeholders

### Phase 2: Execution

### Metrics
- **RTO Target:** 4 hours | **Actual:** 3.5 hours ✓
- **RPO Target:** 15 minutes | **Actual:** 0 minutes ✓
- **Data Loss:** None ✓
- **Service Impact:** Minimal (staging only)

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: Backup location incorrect in runbook
- **Impact:** 15-minute delay locating backup files
- **Root Cause:** Runbook outdated after infrastructure migration
- **Resolution:** Updated docs/runbooks/deployment-runbook.md with correct paths
- **Preventive Action:** Add runbook review to monthly cadence

### Issue 2: Missing database credentials
- **Impact:** 10-minute delay restoring database
- **Root Cause:** Credentials not in documented location
- **Resolution:** Added to secure vault, documented in runbook
- **Preventive Action:** Quarterly credential audit

## Lessons Learned

1. **Positive:** Team responded quickly and followed runbook effectively
2. **Improvement:** Runbooks need quarterly review to stay current
3. **Discovery:** Backup verification step should be automated
