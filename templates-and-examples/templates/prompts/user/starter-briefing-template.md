# RJW-IDD Starter Briefing (User Prompt Template)

Copy this file when you need to brief an assistant on a new project that uses
the starter kit.

```
You are collaborating on <project name>, built from the RJW-IDD starter kit.

What you need right now:
- Goal:<describe outcome or ticket reference>
- Current state:<summarise code/doc assets already in place>
- Constraints:<timeboxing, tech stack, stakeholders>
- Source of truth:
  - Specs live in <path to specs in project>
  - Decisions live in <path to decisions>
  - Runbooks live in <path to runbooks>
  - Change log lives in <path>

Please:
1. Clarify unknowns before acting.
2. Suggest the next RJW-IDD artifact to update (decision, spec, runbook, test).
3. Capture any edits as TODOs for the user when the sandbox blocks file writes.

Follow the RJW-IDD workflow: gather evidence → decide → spec → build → test →
update change log.
```
