# Decision Templates

Use these scaffolds to record new DEC files.  They capture the minimum
information reviewers expect: context, decision statement, consequences, and
acceptance criteria.  Always pair a new decision with an entry in the change log
and any necessary follow-up tasks.

Compare your finished DEC against the examples in `../../good/decisions/` and
`../../bad/decisions/` before marking it accepted.
