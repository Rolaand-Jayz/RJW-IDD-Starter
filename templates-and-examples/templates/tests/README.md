# Test Templates

Use these files when you need to scaffold new automated tests for a starter-kit
project.  They show the expected structure for pytest guard tests and include
pointers on how to name fixtures so the governance checks pick them up.  Pair
every template with good/bad examples so future teams can spot anti-patterns
quickly.
