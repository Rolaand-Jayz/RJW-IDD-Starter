"""
Pytest template for RJW-IDD starter projects.

Instructions:
1. Rename this file following the `test_<area>.py` convention.
2. Replace the placeholder test with assertions that exercise the new
   behaviour. Guards should fail first (`pytest` red) before passing.
3. Reference related decisions/specs in docstrings by path so traceability
   remains intact.
