# Standard â€” Review Stuff (Bad Example)

- Follow best practices.
- Reviewers should look at the code.
- If something feels wrong, comment on the PR.

There is no connection to decisions, specs, evidence, or automation. Nothing
explains how to apply or enforce the standard, which is why this example is
flagged as "bad."
