# Decision â€” Skip Tests to Save Time (Bad Example)

- **Date:** TBD  
- **Participants:** "Everyone"  
- **Problem:** "We are busy."

## Candidate Options
- Do what we always do.

## Evaluation
- N/A

## Decision
Ship it tonight. We do not have time to write specs or update the change log.

## Follow-Up
- Somebody should maybe look at the dashboards later.

> This example shows what *not* to do: vague participants, missing evidence,
> no option trade-offs, and no traceability back to specs, tests, or logs.
