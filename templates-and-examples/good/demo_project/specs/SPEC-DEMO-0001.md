# SPEC-DEMO-0001: "Clear" Button Functional Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Related Decision:** `DEC-DEMO-0001`

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the functional requirements for the "Clear" button feature in the calculator application.

## 2. Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-DEMO-0001 | The calculator UI must include a button labeled "C". | The "C" button is visually present in the calculator's button grid. |
| REQ-DEMO-0002 | When the "C" button is pressed, the currently displayed value must be reset to "0". | Pressing the button changes the display from any number (e.g., "123") to "0". |
| REQ-DEMO-0003 | Pressing the "C" button must also clear any internal calculation state. | After pressing "C", starting a new operation (e.g., "0" + "5" + "+") should result in a correct calculation ("5") and not be affected by the previous state. |

## 3. Technical Notes

- The button should be styled consistently with the other buttons in the application.
- The "clear" function should handle edge cases, such as clearing an already zero or empty display, without errors.
