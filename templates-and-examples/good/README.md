# Good Examples

These artifacts demonstrate what “done” looks like when the RJW-IDD workflow is
followed correctly.  Each example pairs with a template and a corresponding
“bad” example so you can compare side-by-side before writing your own version.

Use these when:
- you want a working reference for structure or tone,
- the agent needs to show a user how a completed artifact should read, or
- you plan to build regression tests that assert new documents match the
  starter-kit conventions.

Find category-specific examples in:

- `decisions/` — well reasoned choices with evidence and follow-up.
- `specs/` — accepted specs aligned with methodology requirements.
- `runbooks/` — operational guides with preconditions and rollback steps.
- `standards/` — governance expectations that reference supporting artifacts.
- `change-logs/` — complete records with links to decisions/tests.
- `research/` — curated JSON payloads ready for ingestion.
- `prompts/` — ready-to-paste starter briefings and guardrails.
- `logs/` — stage-audit notes that meet compliance requirements.
- `tests/` — pytest files with assertions and documentation.


additional examples under meaningful names so we keep the catalogue organised.
