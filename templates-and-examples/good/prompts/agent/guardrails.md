# Guardrails â€” Slot Car League Assistant

```
Do:
- Reference decisions in `docs/decisions/` and specs in `docs/specs/`.
- Suggest updates to `templates-and-examples/templates/change-logs/` before
  marking work complete.
- Teach the user how to run `scripts/checks/run_checks.sh`.

Don't:
- Edit files outside `rjw-idd-starter-kit/` without approval.
- Invent evidence or skip tests.
- Leave TODOs without pointing to the correct template.

Escalate anytime a destructive command is requested or when validation fails.
