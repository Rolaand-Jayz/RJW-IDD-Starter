# SPEC-0801 — Service-Level Objectives & Indicators Framework

**Linked Requirements:** REQ-0801-0850 range  
**Linked Decisions:** DEC-SLO-####  
**Status:** Active

## Purpose
Establish service-level objectives (SLOs), service-level indicators (SLIs), and alerting strategies to maintain operational excellence and customer satisfaction.

## Scope
- Covers SLI definition, SLO target setting, alert thresholds, and dashboard requirements.
- Applies to all production services and critical development infrastructure.
- Integrates with observability (`SPEC-0401`), performance metrics (`SPEC-0301`), and deployment operations (`SPEC-0701`).

## SLI Categories

### 1. Availability
**Definition:** Percentage of time service responds successfully to valid requests.

**Measurement:**
```
SLI_availability = (successful_requests / total_requests) * 100
```

**Typical Targets:**
- Critical services: 99.9% (43 minutes downtime/month)
- Standard services: 99.5% (3.6 hours downtime/month)
- Internal tools: 99.0% (7.2 hours downtime/month)

### 2. Latency
**Definition:** Time to complete request processing within acceptable thresholds.

**Measurement:**
- P50, P95, P99 response times
- Separate SLIs for read vs. write operations
- Per-endpoint granularity for complex services

**Typical Targets:**
- API endpoints: P95 < 200ms, P99 < 500ms
- Background jobs: P95 < 5s, P99 < 30s
- Batch processes: Complete within scheduled window

### 3. Error Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of requests resulting in errors.

**Measurement:**
```
SLI_error_rate = (error_responses / total_requests) * 100
```

**Typical Targets:**
- Critical paths: < 0.1% error rate
- Standard operations: < 1% error rate
- Experimental features: < 5% error rate (with monitoring)

### 4. Throughput
**Definition:** Request volume handled successfully per unit time.

**Measurement:**
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Transactions per minute (TPM)
- Jobs processed per hour

**Typical Targets:**
- Baseline capacity: Handle peak load + 30% headroom
- Degraded mode: Maintain 70% throughput during partial outages

### 5. Data Durability
**Definition:** Percentage of data persisted without loss or corruption.

**Measurement:**
- Backup success rate
- Data integrity validation pass rate
- Restore success rate (tested quarterly)

**Typical Targets:**
- Critical data: 99.999% durability
- Standard data: 99.99% durability
- Backup verification: 100% of backups tested annually

## SLO Definition Process

### 1. Identify Service Boundaries
- Define logical service units (APIs, databases, batch jobs).
- Map dependencies and critical paths.
- Document in `docs/implementation/service-catalog.md`.

### 2. Select SLIs
- Choose 3-5 SLIs per service (avoid metric overload).
- Prioritize customer-impacting indicators.
- Ensure SLIs are measurable with existing instrumentation.

### 3. Set SLO Targets
- Base targets on historical performance (if available).
- Consider business requirements and customer expectations.
- Start conservative; tighten after establishing baseline.
- Document rationale in `DEC-SLO-####`.

### 4. Define Error Budgets
**Error Budget:** Allowed failure rate within SLO period.

```
Error Budget = (1 - SLO_target) * total_requests
```

**Example:** 99.9% availability SLO over 30 days
- Allowed downtime: 43 minutes
- If exceeded: Freeze feature work, focus on reliability

## Alerting Strategy

### 1. Alert Tiers

#### Tier 1 - Critical (Page Immediately)
- SLO burn rate indicates budget exhaustion within 1 hour.
- Customer-facing outage detected.
- Data loss or security breach detected.
- **Response:** On-call engineer paged immediately.

#### Tier 2 - High (Page During Business Hours)
- SLO burn rate indicates budget exhaustion within 6 hours.
- Degraded performance affecting subset of users.
- Approaching resource limits (disk, memory, connections).
- **Response:** On-call notified; escalate if not resolved within 30 minutes.

#### Tier 3 - Medium (Ticket Created)
- SLO trend suggests potential future violation.
- Non-critical service degradation.
- Elevated error rates within acceptable range.
- **Response:** Ticket created; addressed during next working day.

#### Tier 4 - Low (Informational)
- SLI variance within normal range but notable.
- Deployment completion notifications.
- Scheduled maintenance reminders.
- **Response:** Dashboard visibility only; no action required.

### 2. Alert Design Principles
- **Actionable:** Every alert must have a corresponding runbook entry.
- **Contextual:** Include service, SLI, current value, threshold, and runbook link.
- **Non-flapping:** Require sustained threshold breach (e.g., 2 out of 3 checks).
- **Tunable:** Review alert thresholds quarterly; adjust based on false positive rate.

### 3. Alert Routing
- Critical alerts → PagerDuty/on-call system → SMS/phone
- High alerts → Slack/Teams channel + email
- Medium/Low alerts → Ticket system + daily digest

## Dashboard Requirements

### 1. Service Health Dashboard
**Contents:**
- Current SLI values vs. SLO targets (last 1h, 24h, 7d, 30d).
- Error budget consumption (% remaining for current period).
- Active incidents and degradations.
- Recent deployments timeline.

**Update Frequency:** Real-time (1-minute granularity).

### 2. SLO Compliance Dashboard
**Contents:**
- Monthly SLO achievement percentage per service.
- Error budget burn rate and runway.
- Top contributors to SLO violations (by error type, endpoint, etc.).
- Trend analysis over 6 months.

**Update Frequency:** Daily aggregate, reviewed weekly.

### 3. Operational Metrics Dashboard
**Contents:**
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network).
- Dependency health (databases, third-party APIs).
- Queue depths and processing lag.
- Cost attribution by service/feature.

**Update Frequency:** 5-minute intervals.

## SLO Governance

### 1. Review Cadence
- **Weekly:** Review SLO compliance in team standup; escalate violations.
- **Monthly:** Governance Sentinel audits error budget consumption; approves SLO adjustments.
- **Quarterly:** Full SLO review with stakeholder input; update targets based on business needs.

### 2. SLO Changes
- Target adjustments require `DEC-SLO-####` with rationale and impact analysis.
- Tightening SLOs: Requires demonstrated capability over 3 months.
- Loosening SLOs: Requires business justification and customer communication plan.
- Document changes in Change Log with effective date.

### 3. Error Budget Policy
**When Error Budget Exhausted:**
1. Freeze all feature deployments except critical fixes.
2. Conduct incident review to identify root causes.
3. Implement corrective actions and postmortems.
4. Resume feature work only after budget replenishes or Governance Board approves override.

## On-Call Rotation

### 1. Rotation Structure
- Primary on-call: First responder (24/7 coverage).
- Secondary on-call: Escalation point if primary unavailable.
- Escalation chain: Service owner → Engineering manager → VP Engineering.

### 2. On-Call Responsibilities
- Respond to Tier 1 alerts within 5 minutes.
- Triage incidents using runbooks (`docs/runbooks/`).
- Document incident timeline in `artifacts/integration/incident-<id>/`.
- Hand off unresolved issues with detailed context.

### 3. On-Call Handoff
- Weekly rotation (Monday 9:00 AM local time).
- Handoff meeting includes: active incidents, recent changes, upcoming deployments.
- Update `docs/status/oncall-status.md` with current primary/secondary contacts.

## Incident Management Integration

### 1. Incident Severity Levels
- **SEV-1 (Critical):** Complete service outage or data loss.
- **SEV-2 (High):** Major functionality degraded; workaround available.
- **SEV-3 (Medium):** Minor functionality affected; limited user impact.
- **SEV-4 (Low):** Cosmetic issue or internal-only impact.

### 2. Incident Response Workflow
1. Detect: Alert fires or manual report.
2. Triage: Assess severity and assign incident commander.
3. Mitigate: Implement temporary fix or rollback per `DOC-0018`.
4. Resolve: Deploy permanent fix and verify restoration.
5. Postmortem: Document in `DEC-####` with prevention plan.

### 3. Incident Artifacts
- Timeline log: `artifacts/integration/incident-<timestamp>/timeline.md`
- Change Log entry with incident reference and resolution verification.
- Decision record with root cause analysis and action items.

## Traceability

- Link SLO definitions to requirements (`REQ-0801+`) and tests (`TEST-0801+`).
- Cross-reference alert runbooks with incident history.
- Tag dashboards with owning team and review date.
- Store SLO configuration in version control with change history.

## Implementation Guidance

- Start with 2-3 SLIs per critical service; expand gradually.
- Use existing observability data (`SPEC-0401`) to baseline SLIs.
- Implement error budgets before enforcing freeze policy.
- Conduct tabletop exercises for incident response before first production deployment.
- Document service-specific SLOs in `docs/implementation/slo-<service>.md`.

## Verification

- SLO compliance reports attached to monthly Change Log summary.
- Governance Sentinel validates alert coverage during quarterly audits.
- Incident postmortems reference SLO impact and budget consumption.
- On-call rotation logs reviewed for gaps in coverage or response time.

## Follow-Up Guidance

- Coordinate with `SPEC-0701` for deployment impact on SLOs.
- Reference `DOC-0018-general-incident-runbook.md` for incident procedures.
- Integrate with cost governance (`SPEC-0602`) to balance reliability vs. expense.
- Capture SLO-related decisions in `docs/decisions/` when business needs evolve.
