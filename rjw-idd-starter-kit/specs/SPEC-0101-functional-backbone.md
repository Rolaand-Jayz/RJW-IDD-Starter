# SPEC-0101 â€” Functional Backbone Template

**Linked Requirements:** Populate after RDD/SDD.  
**Linked Decisions:** Reference the governing `DEC-####`.  
**Status:** Template

## Purpose
Provide a repeatable structure for functional delivery under RJW-IDD. The spec ensures every work item ties back to verified evidence, ledger entries, and synchronized documentation.

## Scope
- Applies to all feature, enhancement, and documentation changes executed under RJW-IDD.
- Governs coordination between agents and humans for backlog refinement, doc updates, and requirement traceability.

## Functional Expectations
1. Every work item originates from a requirement in `artifacts/ledgers/requirement-ledger.csv` with at least one supporting evidence ID.
2. Requirements, specs, tests, and docs must be updated within the same change set unless a decision explicitly defers work.
3. Living documentation must stay current; gaps are logged in `docs/living-docs-reconciliation.md` before coding begins.
4. Change Log entries include impacted IDs, operator, and verification artefacts.

## Process Flow
1. **Intake:** Groom backlog entries, confirming evidence coverage and requirement ownership.
2. **Design:** Update specs with acceptance criteria and list reserved test IDs.
3. **Delivery:** Implementation proceeds only after tests are authored (or reserved) and documentation tasks are identified.
4. **Closeout:** Change Log updated; validators run; audit reflection captured.

## Traceability Controls
- Daily ledger sync (manual or automated) checks for requirements lacking linked specs/tests.
- Validators (`scripts/validate_ids.py`) enforce formatting and cross-links in specs and ledgers.
- Decisions modifying scope must update this spec and regenerate affected tests/docs.

## Follow-Up Guidance
- Tailor sections with domain-specific requirements and acceptance criteria when applying this template to a project.
- Reference companion specs (`SPEC-0201`, `SPEC-0601`) for quality gates and integration expectations.
