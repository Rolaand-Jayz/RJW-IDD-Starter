# SPEC-0501 â€” Security & Privacy Controls Template

**Linked Requirements:** Insert security/privacy requirement IDs.  
**Status:** Template

## Purpose
Document the baseline security, privacy, and sandbox requirements for RJW-IDD initiatives so agent-assisted workflows remain compliant and auditable.

## Scope
- Applies to sandbox tooling, consent flows, credential management, and incident response.
- Covers both human and agent activity across development, staging, and production environments.

## Control Expectations
1. All agent execution occurs in audited sandboxes with revocable credentials and namespace isolation.
2. Telemetry and data sharing require explicit opt-in; consent receipts are stored with Change Log references.
3. Sensitive data handling procedures (PII, secrets, customer content) are documented and enforced.
4. Security drills (sandbox breach, recovery rehearsal) run on a defined cadence with artefacts stored under `logs/security/`.
5. Decisions affecting security posture create/update `DEC-####` entries and refresh runbooks.

## Implementation Guidance
- Provide baseline scripts or references for sandbox reset/drill operations (for example `scripts/sandbox/reset.sh`, `scripts/sandbox/drill.py`).
- Document credential issuance, rotation policies, and escalation paths in runbooks.
- Ensure living documentation details approval flows and evidence requirements.

## Verification
- Maintain automated tests or scripts that validate consent gates, sandbox resets, and drill outputs.
- Include security validation results in Change Log verification columns.
- Governance Sentinel audits security artefacts during each phase exit.
