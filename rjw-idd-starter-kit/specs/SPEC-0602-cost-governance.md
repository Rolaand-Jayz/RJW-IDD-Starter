# SPEC-0602 â€” Cost Governance Template

**Linked Requirements:** Add cost governance requirement IDs.  
**Status:** Template

## Purpose
Provide a repeatable framework for monitoring, reporting, and approving AI-related spend under RJW-IDD.

## Scope
- Applies to model/API usage, infrastructure costs, and supporting tooling.
- Covers dashboards, sign-off processes, and mitigation workflows.

## Expectations
1. Run cost dashboards on a regular cadence (weekly recommended) using scripts such as `scripts/cost/run_weekly_dashboard.py` or project equivalents.
2. Store outputs under `logs/cost/` with timestamps and operator information; include them in Change Log verification columns when spend-related work ships.
3. Capture finance approvals or notes in a dedicated log (Markdown or CSV) alongside dashboard snapshots.
4. Define alert thresholds and required mitigation steps (e.g., throttle usage, model swap, refactor prompts) and log them in decisions/runbooks.
5. Coordinate with security/observability specs to ensure cost controls do not circumvent consent requirements.

## Implementation Guidance
- Tailor the dashboard script to your billing providers and cost metrics.
- Document data sources, refresh cadence, and contact roles in living documentation.
- Include rehearsal procedures in the finance variance runbook (`docs/runbooks/DOC-0015-finance-variance-runbook.md`).

## Verification
- Attach dashboard outputs and finance sign-offs to the Change Log for any cost-impacting change.
- Governance Sentinel reviews cost artefacts during audits and ensures mitigations closed alerts within the agreed time window.
