# Decision Log Directory

Use this folder to store `DEC-####.md` files created from `../../rjw-idd-methodology/templates/PROJECT-DEC-template.md`.

## How to Use
1. Copy the template file into this directory and rename it using the next available decision ID (for example `DEC-0001.md`).
2. Fill in the template sections with your projectâ€™s reasoning, evidence references, and follow-up actions.
3. Update cross-links (change log, specs, requirements, tests, docs) after the decision is final.
4. Remove placeholder comments before committing.

Keep only the decisions that belong to your project; this starter kit intentionally ships with no pre-populated entries.
