# Intelligence-Driven Methodology Standard

- **Owner:** Methodology lead
- **Applies to:** All RJW-IDD projects
- **Last reviewed:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Purpose
Align teams to the intelligence-driven development cycle: evidence → decision →
spec → implementation → validation → documentation.

## Requirements
1. Each cycle records a decision using the starter decision template.
2. Specs, runbooks, and standards updated as soon as decisions affect them.
3. Evidence curated and linked in research indexes before implementation.
4. Change log and logs updated before merge.

## Verification
- Stage audit logs cite evidence coverage and outstanding risks.
- Guards ensure change log, decisions, and specs are present for modified areas.
