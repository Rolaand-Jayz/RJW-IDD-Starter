# Documentation

Starter-kit guidance grouped by focus area:
- `decisions/`, `runbooks/`, `standards/`, `status/` — operational artifacts.
- `prompts/` — split into `user/` and `agent/` prompt libraries.
- `implementation/`, `demos/`, and reference guides (API, IDE setup, etc.).

Each folder includes its own README explaining how to use the contents after the
re-org.
