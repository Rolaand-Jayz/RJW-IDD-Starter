# Prompt Library Overview (Level Zero Friendly)

Welcome! This folder holds every prompt you can copy into your coding helper. Use this README to pick the right prompt quickly.

## Always Start Here
- `PROMPT-CORE-novice-flow.md` — full cycle prompts (Start → Wrap) plus quick helpers for pausing, simplifying, or touring files.
- `AGENT-GUARDRAILS.md` — reminders that keep the helper in plain language, confirm edits, and wrap up cleanly.
- `GLOSSARY.md` — plain-language definitions you can paste when a new term appears.
- `EXAMPLE-CONVERSATIONS.md` — transcripts showing how to ask the helper to run commands, review diffs, and record notes.

## Stage-by-Stage Support (deeper detail)
These prompts are optional. Use them when you are ready for more structure or need extra detail for a specific stage.

- `PROMPT-0001-starter-briefing.md` — gentle repo tour before the real work.
- `PROMPT-0002-implementation-coach.md` — step-by-step guide when you are ready to edit files.
- `PROMPT-0003-spec-translator.md` — helps turn plain needs into a simple spec update.
- `PROMPT-0004-test-navigator.md` — builds a checklist of tests to write and run.
- `PROMPT-0005-doc-sync.md` — keeps documentation and change logs tidy after code edits.
- `PROMPT-0006-governance-audit.md` — final check before sharing your change.
- `PROMPT-0007-change-log-author.md` — writes the change-log entry for you.
- `PROMPT-0008-merge-ready-checklist.md` — confirms everything is ready before a pull request.

## How to Grow the Library
1. Follow the core flow prompts for every RJW-IDD cycle.
2. Ask the helper for extra prompts when you face a new pattern (bug fix, refactor, documentation-only change, etc.).
3. Paste the best ones into `project-prompts.md` so the whole team can reuse them.

## Tips for Level Zero Developers
- Keep requests short and polite. The helper will slow down if you ask it to.
- If you meet a new word, ask, "Explain that in plain language." Make it a habit.
- When the helper finishes a stage, it should tell you which prompt to paste next. If it forgets, remind it with a Quick Helper prompt from the core file.

Use this library as your menu. Over time you will know exactly which prompt to grab without reading every file.
