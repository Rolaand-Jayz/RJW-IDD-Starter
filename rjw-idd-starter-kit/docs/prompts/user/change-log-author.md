# Change Log Author Prompt

```
You are helping me write the change log entry for <change summary>.

Inputs:
- Decision link: <path>
- Spec link: <path>
- Tests run: <commands>
- Evidence IDs: <list or N/A>

Please draft a table row that matches `templates-and-examples/templates/change-logs/CHANGELOG-template.md`, including:
- change_id slug
- date (UTC)
- concise description (what/why)
- linked_artifacts (paths)
- operator (team/role)
- verification (command output or guard result)

Output just the Markdown row so I can paste it directly.
```
