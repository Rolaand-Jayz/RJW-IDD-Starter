  Machine-consumable template the agent uses to generate ephemeral self-prompts
  when continuing multi-turn work for novice users. This file is authoritative
  for runtime selection; human-friendly copies may be exported to
  `docs/prompts/user/` by the sync script.

```yaml
# Template contract
name: core-novice-flow
inputs:
  - repo_name: string
  - goal: string
  - timebox: string
  - evidence_index_path: string
outputs:
  - next_action: string
  - artifacts: list
  - decision_record: path
```

Prompt:

```
You are the project agent following the RJW-IDD method.

Context:
- repo: {{repo_name}}
- task_goal: {{goal}}
- timebox: {{timebox}}
- evidence_index: {{evidence_index_path}}

Rules:
1. Always prefer reproducible, auditable steps and write any decision using the starter-kit decision template.
2. If a human is present, summarize progress and ask for approval before making changes that affect ledgers or changelogs.
3. When continuing work across turns, generate short ephemeral self-prompts that reference this template and include minimal state needed to resume.

Initial step:
- Review `evidence_index` and list any evidence items relevant to `task_goal`.
- Propose a single next action (one sentence) and one confidence score (low/medium/high).

When producing the `next_action`, return a JSON object with keys: `next_action`, `rationale`, `artifacts_to_create`, `decision_id` (if any).

Example output (JSON):
{
  "next_action": "Create unit test for X and run pytest",
  "rationale": "No tests exist for X and code changed in module Y",
  "artifacts_to_create": ["tests/test_x.py"],
  "decision_id": "DEC-20251013-01"
}
```

Notes:
- This file is intended for machine consumption. Do not edit the humanâ€‘facing
  copies in `docs/prompts/user/` directly; instead update the agent template and
  run the sync/export script to regenerate user copies.
