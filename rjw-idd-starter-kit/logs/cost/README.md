# Cost Governance Logs

Store cost dashboards, finance sign-offs, invoice snapshots, and supporting artefacts for each change that touches budgets. Start with `templates-and-examples/templates/log-templates/cost-log-template.md` so guard checks recognise the format. Recommend naming files `cost_dashboard_YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ.json` and `finance_signoff_YYYYMMDD.md` so change-log entries can reference them directly.
