# Cost Governance Logs

Store cost dashboards, finance sign-offs, invoice snapshots, and supporting artefacts for each `change_id` that touches budgets. Recommend naming files `cost_dashboard_YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ.json` and `finance_signoff_YYYYMMDD.md` so Change Log entries can reference them directly.
