# Logs

Operational and governance logs live here. Copy the appropriate format from
`templates-and-examples/templates/log-templates/` (CI, security, cost, RDD
harvest, or stage audits) before recording a new entry so the guard suite can
validate the file. Each subfolder contains examples plus guidance for what to
capture.
