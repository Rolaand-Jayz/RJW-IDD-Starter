# Bad Examples

Use these files to call out the common traps that derail RJW-IDD work: missing
traceability links, vague acceptance criteria, unfilled TODOs, etc.  Pair each
bad example with the matching template and a “good” counterpart so learners can
spot the differences quickly.

Avoid copying anything from here into real projects—these files are only for
training and guard checks.  When you add a new template, remember to update this
folder with an intentionally broken version that explains _why_ it fails.

Quick index:
- `decisions/` — missing evaluation or participants.
- `specs/` — vague scope and no acceptance criteria.
- `runbooks/` — absent owners, steps, or rollback guidance.
- `standards/` — unenforceable expectations.
- `change-logs/` — undated, untraceable entries.
- `research/` — unstructured data without stance or links.
- `prompts/` — briefings and guardrails that leave the assistant guessing.
- `logs/` — audit notes that omit evidence or follow-up.
- `tests/` — files with no assertions or traceability.
