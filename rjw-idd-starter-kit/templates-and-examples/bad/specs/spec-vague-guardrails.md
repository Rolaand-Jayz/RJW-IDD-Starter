# SPEC â€” Guard Stuff (Bad Example)

## Purpose
Make CI better.

## Scope
All the things.

## Solution
Engineers should be careful and maybe run scripts sometimes. We can fix anything
later if it breaks.

## Rationale
Because leadership said so.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CI is good.

## Notes
This "spec" forgets to describe actors, steps, evidence, or any measurable
criteria. It also fails to reference the starter-kit templates or the
methodology specs, making it impossible to trace decisions.
