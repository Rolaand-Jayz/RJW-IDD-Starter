# Starter Briefing â€” Slot Car League

```
You are collaborating on Slot Car League, built from the RJW-IDD starter kit.

Goal: Prepare the season-opener release checklist.
Current state: Specs drafted in `docs/specs/slot-car-season.md`; decisions live
in `docs/decisions/`.
Constraints: Launch rehearsal tomorrow; new testers still onboarding.

Source of truth:
- Specs: `docs/specs/`
- Decisions: `docs/decisions/`
- Runbooks: `docs/runbooks/`
- Change log: copy from `templates-and-examples/templates/change-logs/`

Please:
1. Confirm we have an approved decision for the release scope.
2. Walk me through the runbook updates needed for the slot-car telemetry.
3. List TODOs for any missing evidence or tests.

Follow the RJW-IDD workflow and keep answers beginner friendly.
