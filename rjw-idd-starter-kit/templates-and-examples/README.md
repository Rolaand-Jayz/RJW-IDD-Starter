# Templates and Examples

This directory replaces the old `examples/` dropbox.  It groups every starter-kit
template alongside curated good and bad examples so learners (and agents) can
understand what “right” and “wrong” look like before touching production
artifacts.

```
templates-and-examples/
  templates/   # Copy-from blanks
  good/        # Canonical examples that pass the governance checks
  bad/         # Anti-patterns that demonstrate common mistakes
```

Each subfolder contains README guidance plus assets for every RJW-IDD document
type—decisions, specs, runbooks, standards, change logs, research payloads,
tests, prompts, etc.  When you add a new template, remember to add a matching
good/bad example so the expectations stay obvious.
