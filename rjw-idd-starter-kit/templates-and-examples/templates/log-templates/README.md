# Log Templates

Starter projects frequently need consistent logging formats for audits. Copy the
template that matches the log you are creating:

- `ci-log-template.md`
- `security-log-template.md`
- `cost-log-template.md`
- `rdd-harvest-log-template.md`
- `stage-audit-log-template.md`

Each template includes the required header fields and example rows so you can
drop it into `logs/<area>/` without guesswork. Matching “good” and “bad”
examples live in `../good/logs/` and `../bad/logs/`; use them to check your work
before committing new entries.
