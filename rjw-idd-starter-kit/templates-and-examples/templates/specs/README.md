# Specification Templates

Pick a template in this folder when you need to create a new SPEC document.
Each template keeps the RJW-IDD sections in the expected order (context,
acceptance criteria, verification, etc.) and includes prompts that remind you to
reference the related DEC, tests, and evidence ledgers.

Good and bad spec examples live under `../../good/` and `../../bad/` so you can
review what success and failure look like before submitting a new spec.
