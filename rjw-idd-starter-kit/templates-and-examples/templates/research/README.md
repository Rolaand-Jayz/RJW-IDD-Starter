# Research Templates

Starter-kit projects track evidence requests and harvested data as JSON files.
These templates provide empty, validated shapes for:

- `evidence_tasks.json`
- `evidence_index.json`
- `evidence_index_raw.json`
- `evidence_allowlist.txt`

Copy the template that matches the file you need, keep it empty when adding to a
new repository, and move the populated examples into `../../good/` or
`../../bad/` as reference material.
