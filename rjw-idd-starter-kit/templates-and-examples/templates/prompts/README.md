# Prompt Templates

These templates help you produce consistent prompt packs for the starter kit.
Separate copies exist for human-facing prompts (the ones a user pastes into the
agent) and agent guardrails.  Folder structure:

- `user/starter-briefing-template.md` — initial onboarding briefing.
- `user/stage-helper-template.md` — focused guidance for a specific RJW-IDD
  phase.
- `user/glossary-template.md` — fast glossary refresh.
- `user/example-conversation-template.md` — capture transcripts for training.
- `agent/guardrails-template.md` — sandbox-safe rules for the assistant.
- `agent/reply-template.md` — response framing that keeps tone and structure
  consistent.

Populate both sides whenever you introduce a new workflow so teams can copy the
right file without guesswork, then add matching examples under the `good/` and
`bad/` folders.
