# Research Workspace

Use this folder to track evidence you gather for your project. Start each file
as an empty template (see `templates-and-examples/templates/research/`) and keep
real content under version control:

- `evidence_tasks.json` — harvest jobs you plan to run.
- `evidence_index_raw.json` — raw, unfiltered items.
- `evidence_index.json` — curated evidence that informs decisions/specs.
- `evidence_allowlist.txt` — long-lived evidence IDs beyond the freshness
  window.

Move educational examples into `templates-and-examples/good|bad/research/` so
this workspace always reflects the live project.
