# Workspace

Use this directory for in-flight work products that are not yet part of the governed starter kit. Examples include scratch notes, draft decisions awaiting review, or temporary exports from agents.

- Promote confirmed decisions into `rjw-idd-starter-kit/docs/decisions/` using the project prefixes (`DEC-####`).
- Delete or archive transient files once the governed artefacts are updated to keep the workspace lightweight.

Because the workspace is intentionally unstructured, avoid storing long-lived artefacts here.
