# SPEC-0401 â€” Observability & Telemetry Template

**Linked Requirements:** Insert observability requirement IDs.  
**Status:** Template

## Purpose
Define how telemetry, logging, and tracing operate under RJW-IDD while respecting consent, privacy, and auditability requirements.

## Scope
- Applies to all code paths, agents, and automation that collect or emit telemetry.
- Covers user consent flows, data retention, and integration with dashboards.

## Expectations
1. Telemetry is opt-in: surface explicit consent prompts and persist receipts before emission.
2. Collected data is tagged with traceability metadata (`req_id`, `spec_id`, `test_id`, `change_id`).
3. Sensitive data is minimized or redacted; storage locations are documented in living docs.
4. Observability signals integrate with incident workflows (`DOC-0016`) and cost governance (`SPEC-0602`).
5. Provide clear sampling and retention policies, reviewed at least quarterly.

## Implementation Guidance
- Start with local JSON/CSV artefacts stored under `logs/` before integrating centralized platforms.
- Document data schemas and access controls in `implementation/` notes and runbooks.
- When using external services, capture configuration, scopes, and rotation procedures.

## Verification
- Re-run consent and telemetry regression tests/drills after every change touching instrumentation.
- Include telemetry snapshots and consent receipts in Change Log verification columns.
- Governance Sentinel samples telemetry artefacts during audits to confirm compliance.
