# Project Prompt Library

This file is your personal prompt notebook. Keep it open while you work. When the helper gives you a reusable prompt, drop it here so the next session stays easy.

## Core Prompts (always handy)
These live in `rjw-idd-starter-kit/docs/prompts/user/core-novice-flow.md`. Copy them as needed:
- `Agent Pledge` ‚Äî sets the tone for plain language and RJW-IDD stages.
- `Start ‚Üí Wrap` prompts ‚Äî one prompt per stage so you can run a full cycle without guessing.
- `Quick Helpers` ‚Äî use them to slow the helper down, ask for a file tour, or restate things in simple words.

## Guardrail Prompts
See `rjw-idd-starter-kit/docs/prompts/agent/guardrails.md` for ready-to-send reminders that keep the helper on the rails (plain language, confirmation before edits, end-of-session wrap up).

## Add Your Own Prompts Here
When you capture a new prompt, follow this format so teammates can scan and reuse it:
```
## Short title (use when <moment>)
<exact prompt text>
Notes: <what this prompt delivers or why it matters>
```

### Daily Restart (use when reopening the project)
```
We are picking up the same RJW-IDD cycle from yesterday. Remind me where we stopped, list the open tasks, and tell me the first prompt I should run today.
```
Notes: Keeps the project aligned when there is a break.

### Fix a Failing Test (use when a single test breaks)
```
One test failed. Help me:
1. Restate the failure in simple words.
2. Point me to the file and line I should inspect first.
3. Suggest the smallest fix to try.
4. Tell me which test to run again.
```
Notes: Keeps the fix focused and prevents big rewrites.

### Undo a Change (use when I made a mistake)
```
I changed the wrong thing. Show me the diff, tell me what will happen if we undo it, then roll back the edit safely.
```
Notes: Uses simple language before running any reset commands.

### Sync My Branch (use when git is behind)
```
Help me pull the latest changes. Explain what will happen, resolve any conflicts step by step, and tell me when it is safe to continue.
```
Notes: Keeps git updates calm and narrated.

### Draft a Commit Message (use when ready to commit)
```
We are ready to commit. Draft a commit message in plain words and list the files we are committing. Wait for me to confirm it before running git commands.
```
Notes: Ensures the commit summary makes sense to humans.

### Run the Bootstrap Script (use after cloning)
```
Please run `bash scripts/setup/bootstrap_project.sh` for me. Explain what you are doing, wait for my yes/no before starting, and translate the results into simple words.
```
Notes: Lets the helper drive setup while I stay informed.
